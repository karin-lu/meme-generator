Hello, 
in this page we provide the requested list of resources that we used in the creation of this simple meme-generator.

As a brief overview, our main sources for this website are predominantly from Youtube. In addition, we relied on Chat-GTP in our coding process to help us in solving issues and coding features when we could not find useful or updated tutorials to follow. 

Naturally, we have used our critical mind to shape the website's features even if it was generated from the AI. Therefore, we used Chat-GTP as a supporting tool to fastly and efficiently improve our coding process. 

We apologise in advance if the code taken by Chat-GTP has been directly taken from a pre-exisiting software, we do not have any intention to plagerize anyone. 

Best Regards,
Mei (Yi) Lu, Sami Strack, and Carlotta Tambato

Futhermore, at the very beginning of this project we created a Figma document to envision the style and all the potential features what we originally wanted to implement.
